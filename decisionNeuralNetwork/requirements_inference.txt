# Decision Neural Network - Inference Requirements
# Minimal dependencies for running inference with trained decision models

# Core PyTorch and ML dependencies (required)
torch>=2.0.0
torchvision>=0.15.0
numpy>=1.21.0
pillow>=8.0.0

# Optional: For visualization and GUI interfaces
matplotlib>=3.5.0  # For plotting confidence charts and visualizations
tkinter            # For GUI inference interface (test_inference_gui.py)

# Optional: For batch analysis and reporting
scikit-learn>=1.0.0  # For classification reports and metrics

# Progress tracking (minimal overhead)
tqdm>=4.60.0

# Note: For production inference deployment, consider:
# - torch (CPU-only version) for smaller footprint if no GPU
# - ONNX runtime for cross-platform inference
# - TensorRT for NVIDIA GPU optimization
# - CoreML for Apple Silicon optimization
